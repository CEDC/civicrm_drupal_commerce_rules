# civicrm_drupal_commerce_rules
Rules to help push information from Drupal 7 Commerce transactions into CiviCRM.

_Needed Modules:_

 * Rules
 * Commerce
 * Commerce Donate (if you want to allow a donation to be added in a shopping cart, so they don't need two checkouts)
 * CiviCRM Entity
 * Conditional Rules (to add some conditional logic to the rule)
